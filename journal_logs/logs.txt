Slow day, but solid library study with Manas; met Abhiram after many days.  
Taking GATE prep more seriously (friendsâ€™ momentum helps).  
Spent time with mom; cooked dinner for me and dad.  
Built a small email spam classifier in Python.  
Step by stepâ€”treating daily tasks with discipline and devotion.  
Ended the day with a peaceful walk.

Went beast mode in workout ðŸ’ª
Practiced many Linear Algebra sums
Understood greedy methods in DSA
Built Streamlit interface for email classifier
Learned basic Machine Learning concepts
Realized control > elimination; small post-lunch nap helps regain momentum & avoid bad habits

Gym was closed for Independence Day, but stayed on track with personal goals
Planned to begin exam registrations and reinforced the mindset of giving it my all
Realized the biggest obstacle is myself, and chose peace over happiness or sadness
Talked to friends like Venkat and Anirudh, keeping connections active
Studied a few subjects and completed all daily tasks
Decided to stay consistent, start with aptitude, and carry the motto: no emotions, no reactions

| Iâ€™ll focus on one habit at a time, starting by waking up     |
| before 6 AM. After waking, Iâ€™ll spend 5-10 minutes in peace  |
| to clear my mind before diving into the day. In the evenings,|
| Iâ€™ll take time to journal and reflect on the day. With new    |
| GATE subjects like verbal ability and algorithms coming up,  |
| Iâ€™ll avoid overloading myself with too much information. Iâ€™ll |
| take things slow, stay consistent, and not stress if I miss  |

| Today was inspiring â€” I hit the gym early, came out of my   |
| comfort zone, studied, and learned an important truth:      |
| if I donâ€™t want something, I donâ€™t need to suffer through   |

Journal Entry â€“ 22-08-25

Today I realized something important: I canâ€™t focus on too many things at once. Right now, my capacity is two things, and thatâ€™s okay. Trying to learn multiple programming languages quickly feels immature and unnecessary. So, Iâ€™ve officially decided to stick with Python. Whether itâ€™s AI, ML, DL, data handling, or even math, I want to build everything with this one language. For the first time, I can see a clear path ahead.

Looking back, some decisions change your life. The first for me was joining the gym, and now this feels like the second big one. Also, I had a talk with Krishna during my low phaseâ€”his words genuinely lifted me and gave me the push to keep fighting my inner battles.

As for studies, I was advised to attend lectures first and make proper notes before focusing on DPPs. That makes senseâ€”get the foundation right, then practice. So for now, my goal is simple: finish the notes and attend lectures consistently.

Today, I felt genuinely at peaceâ€”productive, calm, and in control.  
I realized that my peace comes from making non-negotiable decisions and sticking to them.  

Iâ€™ve decided to dedicate fixed blocks of time for my priorities:  
*4â€“6 PM and 10 PMâ€“1 AM for focused study*,  
and *2:30â€“3 PM for limited social media use*.  

Gym sessions are already in motion (went early today; Bhuvanesh came late as usual),  
and Iâ€™m working on clearing my calculus backlog before moving to the regression series.  

Alongside this, Iâ€™ll keep progressing in DSA and Python projectsâ€”both my major and personal onesâ€”  
which require consistent R&D.  

I did slip with snacks today and want to avoid that moving forward,  
but overall, Iâ€™m happy with my flow and even enjoyed todayâ€™s AI talk.

Today felt smooth and productive. For the first time in a while, I was able
to finish everything I had planned, keeping a slow but consistent pace. I
completed my workout, attended my classes, and started working on Python.
I plan to continue this while also diving deeper into R and ML/DL. I
managed to make notes on regression and classification, which felt good.

Overall, the day felt controlled and balanced, though I might tweak my
workout split slightly in the coming days. I also noticed a subtle fear of
losing creeping in subconsciously. I need to remind myself that I am
preparing for an exam, and that one day I will be giving it. Focusing on
preparation with this mindset is more important than passive worry.

I hope the next few days go by as smoothly and productively as today.

- Cleaned PC and transferred all project files to main repo for interviews.
- Need to regain momentum â€” restarting calculus tomorrow.
- Went for a walk with mom in the park after a long time â€” felt good.

Journal Entry - 31-08-25

Had a rough few days, but things are stable now. Staying at my brotherâ€™s place. Met dad at the hospital â€” heâ€™s fine for now.

Exam on the 1st. Will take 1â€“2 mocks tonight or one in the morning. Went for a night drive with my brother, changed the bike seat to brown.

Might be at Bhuvaneshâ€™s tomorrow but will write the test from here. Feeling curious about the future, but focused on doing my dharma.

Will log again after the exam.


journal entry 2-09-25

Finished the test: aptitude went really well, coding section wasnâ€™t as strong.

Feeling anxious, waiting for Deloitte shortlist â€” hoping for same-day results.

Have strong organizational and domain knowledge as a project coordinator.

Logic for DSA is there, but code conversion needs improvement.

If Deloitte doesnâ€™t work out, will focus on strengthening coding for upcoming companies.

Positive note: got my brother to join the gym â€” he started a one-month plan.

Experienced some self-doubt and anxious thoughts lately.

Realized that putting results aside and continuing to work brings peace.

Decided to avoid greed or sadness about outcomes â€” focus on self-improvement instead.


journal entry 08-09-25
Life gives opportunities, not fruits. My dharma is to work hard, try, fail, and try again without losing hope. Missing Deloitte taught me resilience. IBM offers a good chance; with Python, Node, C++, and SDLC basics, Iâ€™ll prepare well. Back to the gym with my brothersâ€”aiming for strength, consistency, and growth. Keep head down, work hard, and build both career and self before starting my flute journey.

 today was simple i dont know how long will my fight with the inner me last but i guess it is the different version of me fighting to take the existence i will live my life with honour and peace i know i could have done many bad thing and also many good things till now but i am nither happy or sad i just seek existence in peace so i guess to listen to my own desires and though journalling and staying in silence is a must and being away from lustful and attractive desires is a must to protect my current thoughs so i will continuesly remind to journal it is not a one day thing but a record of existence in my opion next time will not make it this long
